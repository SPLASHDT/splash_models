Briefing: 

This information provides information around the training (tailoring) of random forests to specific time sequences of forecast data. This tailoring to forecast data takes into consideration:

1. Train:test splitting ratio (e.g 20:80, 30:70 etc)
2. Threshold adjustment (0.01-0.99) (binary only) 
3. Hyperparamater optimisation (e.g. number of decision trees, leaf nodes, decision splits etc)
4. Regularisation penality (if needed) defined using lambda.

1. RF1T24 (Binary); "T24" customly trained < 24hrs of forecast data. These models would have greater challenges predicting longerterm (i.e > 24 hours).

2. RF1T48 (Binary); "T48" customly trained between 24-48 hrs of forecast data. These are "mid-range" predictor models trained on forecast data between 24-48 hours. 

3. RF1T72 (Binary); "T72" customly trained to predict overtopping > 48 hours ahead of time. These are "long-range" predictor models.
